## Task 1: Machine Learning - Clustering

**Task:**  
Use any clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.

**User Story:**  
User provides a data point (a row); the program identifies which cluster the data point belongs to and explains why.

## Task 2: Machine Learning - Classification

**Task:**  
Train a classification model on the train sheet and test the algorithm on the test sheet.  
Share target values for the test; these will be evaluated externally.  
If using multiple algorithms, share target values for each and report train accuracy.  
Also, explain your choice of algorithm.

**Approach:**  
- Used **KNeighbors clustering**.  
- The target variable had alphanumeric form (e.g., A52, B41).  
- Built two models: one for the alphabetic part and one for the numeric part.  
- Achieved **train accuracy: 99.2%**.

## Task 3: Python Coding

**Task:**  
From `rawdata`, derive:
1. Datewise total duration for each "inside" and "outside".
2. Datewise number of picking and placing activities performed.

**Approach:**  
- Implemented with a hardcoded Python script to compute the required outputs.
