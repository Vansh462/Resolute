Task 1: Machine Learning - Clustering
Task: Use any clustering technique to extract patterns or segregate data into groups.
User Story: User should be able to provide a data point (a row) and program should be able to identify
to which cluster given data point belongs to and why?

Task 2: Machine Learning - Classification
Task: Train any classification model(s) on the train sheet and test your algorithm on the test sheet.
Share target values for the test, we will evaluate from our end.
If using multiple algorithms, plz share target values for each algorithm.
Also share your algorithmâ€™s train accuracy and mention the reason behind choosing your algorithm

(for task 1 & 2 I used KNeighbors clustering , The target variable was in alphanumeric form like A52 , B41. So i made two models each for alphabet and numerical part and got an train accuracy of 99.2 %. I wasn't provided test resulst to calc test accuracy)

Task 3: Python
Task: Use rawdata as input and derive
1. Datewise total duration for each inside and outside.
2. Datewise number of picking and placing activity done.

(for task3 i hardcoded py script to calc the output)
